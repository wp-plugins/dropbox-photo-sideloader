== Description ==

Adds a new tab to the Add media screen, allowing you to pull images from Dropbox into WordPress.

Note: Read the installation instructions. This is an early-release plugin, it requires manual configuration (editing the code) for the moment.


Credit:
This plugin uses the Dropbox PHP code from https://github.com/Dropbox-PHP/dropbox-php.


== Installation ==

Setup:

* Visit https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps and Click "Create an App".
* Give it a name and description.
* Select "Full Dropbox" so that it can access all your files.
* After the app has been created, copy the App Key and App Secret into the plugin (you will need to edit the plugin to do this)
* Note: You can leave the App in "Development" status unless more people than just you need to access their Dropboxes using the plugin.

Once you've setup the application, go create a new post (or edit an old one) and go to the Add Image popup screen. You'll find a new tab on the right called "Dropbox Images", where you'll find an interface to browse your Dropbox and select images for Sideloading into WordPress.
